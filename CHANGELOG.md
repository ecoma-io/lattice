### Bug Fixes

* **lattice:** refuse --evidence-out where nothing would write, and count three workspace checks ([#211](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/211)) ([c9e1ac3](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/c9e1ac3d2f221d2a4d8b19b863d5090f55078b5a))
* **workspace:** correct three stale skill claims and teach four shipped surfaces ([#209](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/209)) ([c3578fa](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/c3578fa65b358b6a73b55314b5a0025367f5a6fe))

## [0.10.1](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1) (2026-08-22)


### Bug Fixes

* **ci:** reach every registry the 0.10.0 release was supposed to ([#208](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/208)) ([b8f657a](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/b8f657a6f544ff7a8ca0731813be13e8fb9edbf5))


### Documentation

* **workspace:** reconcile the documentation with what [#202](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/202) and [#204](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/204) shipped ([#205](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/205)) ([9ad3179](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/9ad31797d2329d37095fa7e5c3338c2161a2931c))

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) (2026-08-22)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lattice:** a Rust file with a top-level `use { … }` group now reports one import record per arm, each resolving on its own, instead of one unresolvable record and one failure. A workspace whose CI was green over such a file can go red on a boundary its imports really cross. On ripgrep the change is 29 failures and 439 records becoming 0 failures and 482 records; the coverage lane's pinned counts move with it.
* **lattice:** add tag-axis-isolation, and the corpus that proved it was missing ([#201](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/201))

### Features

* **lattice:** add tag-axis-isolation, and the corpus that proved it was missing ([#201](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/201)) ([9f37cc0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/9f37cc0e7a05a98bbb62971a68594b9c4e5904a9))
* **lattice:** custom architecture rules under one contract, with four SDKs ([#202](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/202)) ([91a7f08](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/91a7f08a20a7950a30597a52e3382894f627cef0))

* **workspace:** point AGENTS.md at rule owners and make package guidance host-neutral ([#199](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/199)) ([233ceb6](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/233ceb69966b4b126dd6faf4f9d0b5534a89ea7b))

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0) (2026-08-21)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lattice:** `drift` on a workspace that declares an architecture intent, declares no loadable boundary config, and whose intent rows carry no `decisionRef` now completes with exit 0 and a real verdict instead of exiting 3. No workspace that has a boundary config changes verdict, and no workspace whose intent cites anything changes exit code. The direction is a refusal lifting rather than a new finding appearing, so a consumer's CI turns green rather than red — but it is a change to what is reported on an unchanged workspace.
* **lattice:** read a Go import block whose opener follows a `;` ([#195](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/195))
* **lattice:** a workspace containing a `;`-opened Go import block now reports the imports inside it, so a boundary violation that was invisible can turn a previously green run red on unchanged sources.

### Features

* **lattice:** add report, one architecture governance document ([#192](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/192)) ([d9114a0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/d9114a0963597d099ed2eb30728b31e1379bbac0))
* **lattice:** ship four architecture styles as policy packs ([#191](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/191)) ([cfa4981](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/cfa498182c7231bf2a2ed2c039f5d99c87055b4e))
* **workspace:** add the arch-migrate skill and the migration workflow guide ([#190](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/190)) ([2b8df8a](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/2b8df8af33d6d3fe763d935ce2495325d336abab))


### Bug Fixes

* **lattice:** classify upstream noise and scoped configs instead of failing the differential ([#189](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/189)) ([1993fa7](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/1993fa760c23a1a66536dced8ffeb1a8d4592780))
* **lattice:** lift drift's undocumented refusal and pin the governance surfaces ([#196](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/196)) ([a7486ec](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/a7486ecfb71ca0f9764c9ab6c487324a06240f9b))
* **lattice:** read a Go import block whose opener follows a `;` ([6b80844](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/6b80844b3d383d7854bff44f4610af19f82cb044))

* **workspace:** correct stale skill and host-doc claims, cover all providers ([#188](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/188)) ([0e47f6b](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/0e47f6b48b5fdc3908f1c822ad4948728771f61a))


### Documentation

* **docs:** reorganize docs into doctrine/ and slim the README to a landing page ([#186](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/186)) ([630a1ef](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/630a1ef6ac5446cf7347feaefb0570aeb9b4e005))
* **docs:** sync every page the six governance merges made stale ([#197](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/197)) ([151e5fd](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/151e5fdf03747519ca16e0537dd9ebab89c8c0f4))

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.7.1...v0.8.0) (2026-08-20)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lattice:** `check --format sarif` now emits results/notifications for fitness functions (new `fitnessFunctionFailed` rule id); `diff`/`drift` text reports now append `coverage.notes`/`verdict.notes` to their summary line when present; a `history --output` path that resolves into the history directory via `..` is now refused (exit 2) instead of silently accepted; a `check` no-verdict run's `decision.reason` may now name more than one cause; and `check --output`'s stderr summary may now mention fitness counts it previously omitted. Each of these changes reported output on a workspace that already carried the underlying condition — no previously-clean workspace is affected.
* **lattice:** on an unchanged workspace, a Rust file with two or more `use` statements sharing one line, or a same-line attribute whose own content holds a bracketed string, now reports every crossing instead of silently dropping the later one(s) — a consumer's `bannedExternalImports`/boundary check can newly flag an import it missed before. A workspace where a project sits at the Cargo workspace root — spelled either `""` or Nx's own `"."` — now gets graph edges into and out of that project (both directions) that were previously silently absent, which can newly surface `nx affected`/boundary findings for that project. A `.rs` file with a same-line attribute containing many `"` characters and no closing `]` no longer causes catastrophic backtracking in the CLI or language server.
* **lattice:** an unchanged Python workspace can now report imports and manifest edges it previously missed — a multi-line `from x import (...)` group with a `#` comment before its closing paren, `from .import x` / `from ..import y`, a uv array-of-sources dependency, a root project's own declared dependencies, and a `path`-form uv source that names the workspace root. A consumer relying on the prior (silent) output will see new findings on code they did not touch.
* **lattice:** on an unchanged workspace, `reconcile --propose` can now emit `tag-change` candidates for a required project missing a required tag (previously silently omitted, since `buildRankedCandidates` never scanned `scores.tags`). `reconcile` and `drift` can now report a boundary divergence (`intentForbiddenEdge`/`intentAllowedMissing`) that previously silently scored `match` when its `(boundaryFrom, boundaryTo)` pair collided, under naive string concatenation, with another row's pair. `debt`'s JSON and text output no longer serialize `byKind["expired-waiver"]` as `null` for a workspace carrying an expired waiver — it now reports the correct integer count. A consumer's CI or saved baseline for any of these three commands can turn red on a workspace it did not otherwise change.
* **lattice:** name malformed fitness shapes and stop silently dropping ESLint scope ([#177](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/177))
* **lattice:** stop the Moon provider from doubling an implicit edge as static ([#176](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/176))
* **lattice:** on an unchanged Moon workspace, a project dependency that Moon marks implicit (and that also appears in `raw.graph.edges`, the common case) now reports as exactly one `implicit` edge instead of two edges (one `implicit`, one `static`/`dynamic`). `drift`, `discover`, and `check`'s edge-constraint exclusion — everything keying off `edge.type === "implicit"` — now correctly excludes it; previously the phantom `static`/`dynamic` duplicate made it look like a real, code-derived dependency.
* **lattice:** read Go imports and root-module edges the analyzer silently dropped
* **lattice:** the Go dependency graph now reports imports and root-module edges it previously dropped; a consumer's `nx affected`/boundary output may change on unchanged code.
* **lattice:** close three silent-stale gaps in the language server
* **lattice:** an editor session against an unchanged workspace can now report differently in three cases: (1) editing a boundaryConfig whose path has directory components triggers re-diagnosis where it previously did not; (2) a didChange batch mixing a full change with a trailing ranged edit now publishes a loud analysisFailure diagnostic instead of a (possibly wrong) analyzed:true verdict; (3) a workspace root with a filesystem-present but git-untracked lattice.json is now analyzed through the native provider instead of yielding an empty, falsely-clean index.

### Bug Fixes

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2026-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lattice:** v1 intent completeness gate and adversarial fixes ([#69](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/69)) ([8c9526b](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/8c9526b68d6c9ff6e5d7ee4984b40872831dbe97))

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (2026-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lattice:** JSON output now uses schemaVersion 2 and includes the expanded result contract.

### Features

* **lattice:** harden command evidence and graph diffs ([#67](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/67)) ([9a0219b](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/9a0219b127fda5444dc4d1d1fab972c1b62c7247))

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2026-08-14)


### Features

* **lattice:** context, diff rule-impact, impact constraint-context, adversarial fixes ([#65](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/65)) ([86f19f6](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/86f19f61e1b8959829eaf476877e2a056ab3c66b))

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lattice:** tags must use dash separators (type-lib, not type:lib) when using the Moon provider, because Moon tag validation rejects colons. Existing constraint tables in Moon workspaces need to switch from colon to dash format.
* **lattice:** normalise Nx root-project root '.' to '' in createWorkspace ([#56](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/56))
* **lattice:** TypeScript import-type queries now participate in boundary analysis and can produce new findings on unchanged workspaces.
* **lattice:** reported results change on unchanged workspaces, in both directions. A tree declaring a complete non-default workspaceLayout can gain noRelativeOrAbsoluteImportsAcrossLibraries findings that were previously missed; a tree declaring a partial workspaceLayout now exits 3 with no verdict instead of silently running half the rule.
* **workspace:** the npm package name, both bin names, the Nx plugin specifier in nx.json, and the SARIF tool.driver.name all change; existing code-scanning alerts re-key, and consumers must reinstall under the new name and update their nx.json plugins entry.

### Features

* **ci:** prove the native provider against this tree and the real-tree differential ([#37](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/issues/37)) ([9abd440](https://github.com/ecoma-io/lattice/commit/9abd440e285284b01d6528b2761403041bdec347))
