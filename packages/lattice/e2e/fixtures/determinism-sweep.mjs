// Determinism-sweep workspace: the native monorepo (`app → api → core`, three
// Go projects, `lattice.json`, no `nx`) declared in `native-monorepo.mjs`,
// plus the two files the sweep's command surface reads that the monorepo
// fixture alone does not carry: a canonical `architecture-intent.json` (for
// `drift`/`check`'s drift fold/`reconcile`) and a recorded architecture
// decision under the ADR directory (for `adr`).
//
// The intent is the one canonical contract an installed Lattice reads — strict
// JSON, the `version`-leading schema `src/architecture-intent/model.mjs`
// validates — matching the tree exactly so the sweep's clean runs are clean.
// The violating variant forbids the one dependency the observed graph really
// has (`app → api`), and can additionally carry a `boundarySuppressions`
// waiver so `waivers` has a wall-clock field to disclose.
//
// The Nx profile variant is the same two-Go-project Nx consumer the Nx
// fixture builds, with the plugin options naming a `profiles` registry and
// `boundaryConfig` as a profile NAME — the one provider shape where a policy
// is selected by name rather than by file (`docs/concepts/profiles.md`,
// "Selecting by name").
